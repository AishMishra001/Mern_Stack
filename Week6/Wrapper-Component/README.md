# Note : 

1. In React, a wrapper component is a reusable component that encapsulates other components or HTML elements to provide additional functionality or styling.

2. It serves as a container, handling common tasks such as applying consistent styles, managing state, or adding event listeners, allowing developers to reuse these functionalities without repetition.
