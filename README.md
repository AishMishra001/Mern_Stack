# MERN Stack Development Journey

Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack development journey repository! Here, I document my progress and learning as I delve deeper into mastering the MERN stack over the course of several weeks.

## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my journey through learning and implementing various aspects of MERN stack development. Each week, I focus on different topics and skills, building upon my existing knowledge to create real-world applications and enhance my understanding of full-stack development.

## Weekly Progress

- **Week 1: Jargons of JavaScript**
  - Covered fundamental JavaScript concepts such as anonymous functions, asynchronous functions, callbacks, classes, dates, JSON handling, objects, promises, and the async-await pattern.

- **Week 2: Backend Exploration**
  - Explored Node.js and Express, creating robust routes, understanding the Node runtime environment, mastering JavaScript essentials like filter and map, and delving into essential bash commands.

- **Week 3: Authentication and Database Mastery**
  - Dived deep into authentication, JWT, error handling with try-catch, and verifying JWT tokens.
  - Explored MongoDB with Mongoose, mastering CRUD operations, schema validation with Zod, fetching data, and crafting middleware.

- **Week 4: Getting Hands-on with React**
  - Stepped into the world of DOM manipulation, laid the foundation of React, and went deeper into MongoDB.
  - Understood the concepts of state, components, and re-rendering in React applications.

- **Week 5: Building Real-world Applications**
  - Took my skills to the next level by building an end-to-end todo application, complete with backend routes and handlers, leveraging the power of the MERN stack to create seamless user experiences.

- **Week 6: Embracing React Hooks**
  - Currently immersing myself in React Hooks, unlocking new possibilities for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
