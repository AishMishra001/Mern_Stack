Debouncing:
Debouncing is a method used to ensure that a function is not called more often than a certain time interval, even if the event that triggers the function occurs more frequently. 

Throttling:
Throttling is similar to debouncing in that it limits the rate at which a function can be executed, but it does so by ensuring that the function is only called at most once every specified interval. 

Here we are creating a Debouncing function so to reduce the number of backend  request calls 
oninput ="" : to send backend request without using the calculate button as onclick we use oninput we call the backend everytime input is written . 

Then created an bouncing function which call the main function when it is not called for 1 sec and if called between 1 sec it starts the timer again from zero
