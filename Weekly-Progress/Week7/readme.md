# Week 6 Important points : 

## Routing : 

1. Single Page Applications : Single-page applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the application. In React, SPAs are typically created using client-side routing and a client-side bundle.

2. Client Side Routing : Client-side routing is a technique used in single-page applications (SPAs) to navigate between different views or pages without requiring a full page reload. This is achieved by using JavaScript to manipulate the browser's history and URL, and to update the DOM with the new view or page.

In React, client-side routing is typically implemented using the react-router library. This library provides a set of components and hooks that can be used to define routes, navigate between them, and access route parameters and query strings.

3. Client Side Bundle : A client-side bundle is a collection of JavaScript, CSS, and other assets that are loaded by the browser when a user visits a web page. In the context of React, a client-side bundle typically includes the React library, the application code, and any third-party libraries or dependencies.

4. Routing : Routing in React is the process of navigating between different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA). In React, routing is typically implemented using the react-router library, which provides a set of components and hooks for defining routes, navigating between them, and accessing route parameters and query strings.
