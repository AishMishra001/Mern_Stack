## ðŸ§± Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js â€” Explained Simply
Static Site Generation (SSG) is one of the three main data fetching strategies in Next.js:

SSR (Server-Side Rendering) | SSG (Static Site Generation) | ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

### ðŸš€ What is Static Site Generation?
With SSG, Next.js pre-renders HTML at build time, and serves the static HTML on every request.
This makes the pages super fast and cache-friendly, since they donâ€™t need to run on the server at request time.

### ðŸ“¦ Use SSG When:
1. The data doesnâ€™t change often

2. SEO is important

3. You want ultra-fast load time

4. Example: Blogs, Docs, Marketing pages, Landing pages
